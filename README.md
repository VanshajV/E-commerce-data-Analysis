# E-commerce-data-Analysis
This project connects a MySQL database with Python for data analysis and visualization.

Tools used include MySQL, Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).

Key features of the project include database connection to MySQL, executing SQL queries, data analysis to count distinct cities, orders, sales, and more, and generating visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and line plots.

To use the project, connect to your MySQL database using mysql.connector, execute the provided SQL queries to retrieve data, and use Python scripts to analyze and visualize the data.

Examples of the analysis include counting distinct cities from customers, calculating the number of orders placed in a year, determining total sales per category, calculating the percentage of installment payments, visualizing the number of customers by state, monthly order counts, revenue contribution by category, and identifying top spending customers.
